A simple site made in a week to showcase my most presentable work since I began building websites.

This portfolio is a simple NodeJS/Angular app (Node here is, for now, only being used as a server and to run gulp) with just 1 page (for now) with a description of the technologies I have used, my resume and a more descriptive timeline of what I've been doing for the past 6 years
